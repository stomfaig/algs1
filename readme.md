## Solutions to Algorithms 1

*In this repository I am collecting my solutions to Bob Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne's Algorithms 1 course, accessed through Coursera. Thus all the questions that might appear in the documents are due to them, and can be freely accessed on the Coursera site.*

So far I've completed the first 8 modules. In this my solutions to the first 5 coding assignments are uploaded. In the future I am planning to upload answers to the interview questions as well, however this might take some time.
